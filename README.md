# Crust Crawler Arms Arbotix
Demo code for the Crust Crawler Arms, to be run on the ArbotiX-M controller.

This repository holds some demo code in the `Crust Crawler Arms` folder, and the library `dynamixel_mx` in the `libraries` folder. You should put these into your sketchbook folder, and everything should run. 

The initial _hello world_ program is the `hello_arm.ino`, you should try this out first.
